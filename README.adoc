= Mopicon

A client for https://mopidy.com[Mopidy] implemented with Flutter and Dart.

Although Mopicon is styled as an Android app, it compiles into a native application on other platforms as well.
It also compiles into a Web application and could also be turned into a Mopidy server-side extension by implementing the necessary Python boilerplate (which does not exist, yet).

The list of search results, tracklist and playlists all support item selection by dragging an item from left to right.
Selection can also be performed by a long mouse button press.
Once one item is selected, additional items can be selected or deselected by tapping an item.
Additionally, in playlists and in the tracklist, items can be reordered by vertically dragging an item to a new position.

== Plenty of clients exist, why yet another Mopidy client?

The main reasons I started this project:

* I wanted to learn Dart and Flutter.
* I wanted to build the UI to my very personal taste.

DISCLAIMER:: This is my very first Flutter/Dart project.
Take the code with a grain of salt.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

First of all, you need a properly configured Mopidy server.
See the https://mopidy.com/[Mopidy]
website for details about installing and configuration.

In order to run or build the application, you need at least `Dart 3.0.0` and `Flutter 3.13.0`
installed.

=== Running the Application

Clone this repository and execute

   flutter run

If your Mopidy server is not running on `localhost:6680`, you need to set the correct host and port for your server on Mopicon's `Settings` screen.

NOTE:: If you select a web browser as output device from the displayed list of connected devices, album covers and thumbnails will not be loaded and displayed, because of the browser's security restrictions.
This would only work if the Mopicon web application is loaded from the Mopidy host and port, if Mopicon is installed as a Mopidy extension, for example.

In order to build the application as an executable on Linux, for example, invoke

    flutter build linux

== Development

For Development, I used Android Studio 2022.3.1 with `Flutter Intl` plugin installed.

This project uses my https://github.com/nerk/mopidy_dart_client[mopidy_dart_client] library for communicating via a Websocket to the Mopidy server.
